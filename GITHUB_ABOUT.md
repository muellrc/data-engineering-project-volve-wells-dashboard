---

**A comprehensive data engineering project demonstrating ETL pipelines, data visualization, and LLM integration. Processes Well Technical Data and Production Data from the open Volve dataset (Equinor, 2018), transforming and loading it into PostgreSQL via Luigi workflows, visualizing it in Grafana dashboards, and enabling natural language database queries through an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for AI assistant integration.**

---

## Alternative Shorter Version:

**Data engineering project with ETL pipelines, PostgreSQL, Grafana dashboards, and MCP server for LLM integration. Processes Volve wells dataset with Luigi workflows and enables AI-powered natural language database queries.**

---

## Alternative Detailed Version:

**A full-stack data engineering project showcasing modern data pipeline architecture. Extracts Well Technical Data and Production Data from the open Volve dataset (Equinor, 2018), transforms and validates it using Python and Luigi batch workflows, loads it into PostgreSQL, and visualizes it through interactive Grafana dashboards. Features an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables LLM integration, allowing AI assistants like Claude to query the database using natural language. Demonstrates containerized microservices architecture, ETL best practices, and cutting-edge AI/LLM integration patterns.**
